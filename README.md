## Plastic-detection

### Overview

This repository contains code for developing a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of plastic waste. The project explores different neural network architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and employs transfer learning with pre-trained models such as VGG16, VGG19, and Xception. Through this project, skills in data preprocessing, model training, validation, and fine-tuning were enhanced to achieve satisfactory classification scores.

### Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of images depicting various types of plastic waste. Each image is labeled with the corresponding class, indicating the type of plastic waste it represents. The dataset was preprocessed to ensure uniformity and quality for training the deep learning models.

###  Neural Network Architectures

The following neural network architectures were explored:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Custom CNN architectures were designed and trained from scratch to learn features directly from the plastic waste images.

- **Transfer Learning**: Transfer learning was employed using pre-trained models, including VGG16, VGG19, and Xception. These models were fine-tuned on the plastic waste image dataset to leverage features learned from large-scale image datasets.
